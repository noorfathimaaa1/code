task 1:
1. Write a program to print all the even numbers between 1 and 20, skipping the number 10
 using a continue statement.
2. Create a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter a negative number. Print the
 sum of all the positive numbers entered by the user, terminating the loop when a negative
 number is entered using a break statement.
3. Write a program to find the first 5 multiples of 3, but if a multiple of 3 is divisible by 4, skip it
 using a continue statement.

task 2:

7. Develop a program that asks the user for numbers until they enter 0. Print the sum of all the
 numbers entered by the user except for the number 7, using a continue statement to skip
 adding 7 to the sum.
 8. Create a program that generates random numbers between 1 and 100 until it generates a
 number that is a perfect square. Print the number and its square root, then terminate the loop
 using a break statement.
 9. Write a program to print all the vowels in a given string, but skip printing if the character is a
 space using a continue statement.

task 3:

1.Create a base class called Shape with a method area. Create subclasses Circle, Square,
 and Triangle that implement the area method. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a list
 of different shape objects and iterating through it to calculate their areas.
 2.Create a class called Rectangle with private attributes for width and height. Provide getter
 and setter methods to access and modify these attributes. Include a method to calculate the
 area of the rectangle.
 
task 4:

1.Develop a program that simulates a game of rolling a dice. Roll the dice until you get a 6,
 and count the number of rolls it takes to get a 6. Print the count using a break statement.
 2. Create a class Teacher with name ,age,and salary attributes where salary must be private
 attribute that cannot be accessed outside the class.
 3.Write a Python program to create a person class. Include attributes like name, country and
 date of birth. Implement a method to determine the person's age.
